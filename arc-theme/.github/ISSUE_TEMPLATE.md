- The theme doesn't work in a distribution that have a GTK+ 3 version lower than 3.14.
  - Arc only supports versions since 3.14, you should update to latest versions.
- The theme is broken after a major GTK+ 3 update (i.e. 3.18 to 3.20 or 3.20 to 3.22).
  - Update the package or install from sources.
- The theme is broken after installing from sources.
  - Possibly a bug on GTK+ 3 version checking, use `--with-gnome=<version>` flag with `./autogen.sh`.

  - Transparency isn't supported for non-CSD applications.
- Theme doesn't build from AUR in Arch/Manjaro and others.
